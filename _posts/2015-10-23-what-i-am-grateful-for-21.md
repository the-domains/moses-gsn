# What I am grateful for \#21

Thinking back, I am stunned by how many times  I had chance to build a significant and meaningful mentoring relationship where I was able to lead someone just a bit younger than me.

What an amazing privilege it is to be able to build up someone when I myself am still yet to gain deep wisdom and experience that only comes when true struggles ensue in life.
