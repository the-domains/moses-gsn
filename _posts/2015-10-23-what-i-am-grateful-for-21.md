# What I am grateful for \#21

Thinking back, I am stunned by how many times  I had chance to build a significant and meaningful mentoring relationship where I was able to lead someone just a bit younger than me.

What an amazing privilege it is to be able to build up someone when I myself am still yet to gain deep wisdom and experience that only comes when true struggles ensue in life.

Running together in the journey of life is one of the greatest joy I've felt.
