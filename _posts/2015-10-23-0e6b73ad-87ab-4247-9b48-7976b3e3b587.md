# Impromptu is good, sometimes

Today I was able to give an offering presentation even though I was contacted at the very last possible moment before Open Chapel at UC Berkeley. Literally 10 minutes before I walked into the room that was to be the place of gathering.

Yet I was filled with joy despite the impromptu song presentation. I think I really do love singing and playing guitar.

Life is filled with unexpected occurrences regardless of my disposition or my desire at the moment. Yet today I find it subtly enjoyable that life is indeed filled with new opportunities to praise God.

Let the impromptu praise sessions be revived in my life again!
