# What I am grateful for \#4

What an amazing grace it is that I should find someone to love and commit to love for the rest of my life! What an amazing miracle is this that the person whom I committed to love is also willing to commit to love me until death due us apart.

Modern society and current cultural norm is so thoroughly individualistic and self-centered that marriage vows are nowadays only a fleeting, ungraspable utterance that can be retracted at any moment. Perhaps I am very wrong and it is simply that many who deeply desire to keep their vows find lacking in actual ability to make their desire and commitment into reality.

> Come what may, I will love you 'til the end of time

One of the movie that I really enjoyed had this lyric in a beautiful song. Yet I know that though the world is filled with incalculable amount of love songs, very few people seem to be able to actually live out love.

Praise be to God above for being my only hope in sustaining true love for my wife until the last breath. For I know that He who is able to love me so deeply even when I am flawed and broken can also teach me how to love other - even my wife - though it all.

This I am grateful for.
